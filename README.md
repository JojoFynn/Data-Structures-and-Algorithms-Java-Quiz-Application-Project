# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Java-Quiz-Application-Project
I created a quiz application using Java Programming. I implemented data structures such as Tree Maps and arrays in the application. This was a team project. Kindly read the attached Word document named Report in this repository to understand the code and motivation of the project. Also read the file called Jojo Fynn Mensah to see my contribution to the work.
